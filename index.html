					<h2>Hi, I'm Peter!</h2>
					<p>3 First Names Design is the doppelgänger for my work as a Product & User Experience Designer.</p>
					<p>I’m currently looking to join a team who want to take on big challenges.</p>

					<p>Some people call designers like me a “hybrid designer”, and I’ve never been a fan of that label.</p>
					<p>We’re designers who have experience in UX, UI, and Visual Design, and we might even sprinkle in a little code too - which I do. That was never the goal when I started my career in Design; these were skills and experiences born out of necessity.</p>
					<p>No front-end support? Okay, I’ll learn CSS. No data or research on who we’re designing for? Fine, I’ll call some people who might be interested in this product.</p>
					<p>If you’re hungry and diligent about stacking days-on-top-of-days, you discover you can improvise, adapt, and overcome any design challenge thrown your way. I’ve built my career on that foundation, and it’s served me well as I’ve navigated a range of products and work environments. From eCommerce to video games; from small start-ups to Fortune 500 companies.</p>
					<p>To me, that’s what makes a Product Designer: someone who can see the entire chess board of a project’s design and contributing elements. I’m someone you can hand-off a vague goal, work independently and collaboratively within a team, and to come out the other end with a solution.</p>
					<p>Let’s blaze some trails!</p>
